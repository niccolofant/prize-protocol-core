# üèÜ Prize Protocol v1
Prize Protocol is a protocol for no-loss prize games on Ethereum. Modeled on the well established concept of "no loss lotteries" and "prize savings accounts" the protocol offers a chance to win prizes in exchange for depositing funds. Even if you don't win, you keep all your deposited funds. Prizes are made up of the interest that accrues on all users deposits.
 
Each lottery run lasts 10 days and you can join by simply deposit as little as 1 USDT ($1).
When you join a prize pool, your money is deposited into a yield source. The yield source generates the return that makes up the prizes. Currently, the protocol supports only one yield source, Compound.Finance.

Once you have entered into the pool you will continue to be eligible for future prizes. You do not need to take any further action. You will be eligible until you withdraw the money you deposited.

If you joined a Pool you can check if you‚Äôve won by looking at your ‚Äúaccount‚Äù page after a prize has been awarded. You do not need to claim your winnings. If you win, your winnings will automatically be converted to tickets which will increase your chances of winning again!
